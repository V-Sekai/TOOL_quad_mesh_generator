# QuadWild with Bi-MDF solver

This repo is a fork of [nicopietroni/quadwild](https://github.com/nicopietroni/quadwild). The original readme is preserved as [README_orig.md](README_orig.md)

Its main purpose is to demonstrate the use of Bi-MDF quantization, see our [Project page](https://www.algohex.eu/publications/bimdf-quantization).

The main code for Bi-MDF modeling can be found in [libs/quadretopology/quadretopology/qr_flow.cpp](libs/quadretopology/quadretopology/qr_flow.cpp)

## Changes from original QuadWild

- Add Bi-MDF solver for quantization that can be used instead of Gurobi IQPs
- Changed to CMake build system
- Fixed alignment bug
- Changed commandline arguments
- Extended config file format
- Build without Gurobi -- controlled by CMake variable `QUADRETOPOLOGY_WITH_GUROBI`

## Pre-built binaries

We provide pre-built binaries in the [Releases section](https://github.com/cgg-bern/quadwild-bimdf/releases) for Linux, Windows and MacOS (arm64+x86_64).

## Building (classic)

You will need a relatively recent C++ compiler and CMake.
On MacOS, you can get them from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using `brew install git cmake`.
This will also automatically install the required *XCode Command Line Tools*.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cgg-bern/quadwild-bimdf/
cd quadwild-bimdf
cmake . -B build -DSATSUMA_ENABLE_BLOSSOM5=0
cmake --build build
```


## Usage

```
./build/Build/bin/quadwild path/to/input/mesh.obj  2 config/prep_config/basic_setup.txt
./build/Build/bin/quad_from_patches path/to/input/mesh_rem_p0.obj 123 config/main_config/flow_noalign_lemon.txt
```

Note that you need to add `_rem_p0.obj` to the filename of the input mesh; this is
the output from the main quadwild binary.

We included sample config files in `config/`. To improve output quality, adjust them to your needs :)


## Container-based building and usage with podman

The Dockerfile will most likely also work using Docker, but we didn't test this.

### MacOS specific note
You can install podman using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with `brew install cmake`.

On MacOS, all podman containers live in a Linux VM. If you don't have one yet, create one using
```
podman machine init
```

For a successful build, more memory than the default is requried, and more CPU cores speed it up:

```
podman machine stop
podman machine set --memory 8192 podman-machine-default
podman machine set --cpus 4 podman-machine-default
podman machine start
```

### Building

Create the container:
```
podman build . --build-arg WITH_GUROBI=0 -t quadwild-bimdf
```

### Running
Run the binaries; you need to mount some volume into the container to access your data, for example mapping `/Users`:
```
podman run --rm  --volume /Users:/Users quadwild-bimdf quadwild arguments-as-described-above
podman run --rm  --volume /Users:/Users quadwild-bimdf quad_from_patches arguments-as-described-above
```
